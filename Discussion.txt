1)Andoid Studio would be used.React Native would be difficult to learn and most of the time would be spent on learning,so discarded React Native.
2)AWS RDS would be our cloud database.
3)App data would be stored locally as well as synced to the cloud.(Vice-versa also).
4)For the app to work,it needs to be connected to the Internet.(For creating a reminder too).
5)Static Location for social network - Any friend can add items to my list.He doesn't get to see my real-time location.
  Future enchancement - Dynamic Location 
6)Basic feature of the app(Reminding a user if he is near the location) - a)Brute force approach of converting the current location
to an address and cheecking it with all the user listed locations in the to-do list.b)Geofence
7)Agreed to use slack and github.
8)Nishant and Monish - Handling the UI.Rest of us working on the basic feature for now.

Feasibility:
1)No of API calls from the app is limited to 100 per day.
2)Internet is needed for the app to work.
